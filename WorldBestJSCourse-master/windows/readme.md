# Window Object:  
The window object  represents the global window object  in a Browser. Both the Browser Object Model and the Document Object Model
Are part of window object 

# Browser Object model :
The BOM represents the browser as an object and provides  the method and properties for the interacting with the browser itself (Not directly related to content of the webpage)

# Document Object Model :
The DOM represents the structured document as a tree of object where each object corresponds to a part of the document (such as element ,attributes and the text)

The DOM is primarily concerned with the content of the webpage that allows javascript to interact and manipulate the HTMl document nad the elements 

So , while the DOM is focused on the content of  the page , the BOM is focused onthe borwser enviroment .The window object the BOm and the BOM and The DOM when working in a browser enviroment.

<!--! For dynamically changing the content of  html document using javascript we use the DOM Object Model HUMEI HTML ka DOM tree milta  hei jo ki document object hota hei javascript use object ki tarah access karta hei -->
<!-- !DOM is like a BRidge between the html and the javascript. -->
